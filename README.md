# Compose Text Editor

I've been trying to implement a spell checking text field in Compose, and keep running up against
the limitations of `BasicTextField`. Pretty much out of options, I decided to see what it might take
to replace `BasicTextField` with something that solved all of my needs.

tl;dr it's hard, but maybe not as hard as I had thought.

This is not ready for prime time, but if anyone is interested in collaborating, I think it could
actually work. It just needs some more time and attention.
